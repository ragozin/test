	You might think that the first line of the function would print в__globalв__, because the
	var statement declaring the local variable has not yet been executed. Because of the
	rules of function scope, however, this is not what happens. The local variable is defined
	throughout the body of the function, which means the global variable by the same name
	is hidden throughout the function. Although the local variable is defined throughout,
	it is not actually initialized until the var statement is executed:

	function f() {
		var scope; // Local variable is declared at the top of the function
		console.log(scope); // It exists here, but still has "undefined" value
		scope = "local"; // Now we initialize it and give it a value
		console.log(scope); // And here it has the value we expect
	}
